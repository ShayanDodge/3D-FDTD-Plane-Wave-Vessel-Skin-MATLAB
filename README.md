# Plane Wave Propagation in Real Skin (3D Finite Difference Time Domain Methods)

* This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of the 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulating the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in real skin. The FDTD method is a robust numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in the time domain, widely used to study electromagnetic wave interactions with biological tissues.

## Features
* 3D FDTD Simulation: Implements a full three-dimensional FDTD algorithm to model plane wave propagation in real skin.
* Real Skin Modeling: Accurately represents the complex electromagnetic properties of human skin, including frequency-dependent permittivity, conductivity, and permeability.
* User-Friendly MATLAB Code: Provides clear, well-documented MATLAB scripts that are easy to understand and modify.
* Visualization Tools: Includes functions to visualize electric and magnetic field distributions over time, allowing for detailed analysis of wave behavior in skin.
* Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time steps, and source properties.
